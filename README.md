This is a project that I made to practice my queries in MySQL from the terminal.
It is an artificial library database.

## database.py
In this file you will find the structure of the database and the inserted data.

## firstquerys.py
Creation of different tables and simple queries.

## query2.py
Queries resolved as:
- What nationalities are there?
- How many writers are there from each nationality?
- How many books are there of each nationality?
- What is the average / standard deviation of the price of books?
- What is the maximum / minimum price of a book?
- How would the loan report look?

## query3.py
Make changes with DELETE and UPDATE.

## query_pp.py
JOIN queries practice.

### superquery_pp.py
Queries with conditional IF.
